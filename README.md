# Gpgcrypt

This gem is designed to allow you to manually encrypt/ decrypt RSA encoded messages using GnuPG.   

## Installation

Install the gem:

    $ gem install gpgcrypt

## Usage Template
Encrypting:

    $ gpgcrypt message public_key

Decrypting:

    $ gpgcrypt encrypted_message private_key

## Usage

Have your partner generate a public/private key pair (You may have already done this).  

    $ ssh-keygen -t rsa

Obtain a copy of your partner's public key.  

And then use gpgcrypt to encrypt a message using your partner's public key:

    $ gpgcrypt message.txt public_key_of_recipient_rsa.pub > encrypted_message.txt

Or have your partner decrypt a message of yours using your own private key:

    $ gpgcrypt encrypted_message.txt your_private_key_rsa > message.txt


## Alternate Usage (not yet implemented!)

You can alternatively specify a URL to public keys or messages

Encrypting:

    $ gpgcrypt message.txt github.com/TheNotary/pgp/raw
    Your message has been pastebin'd to http://pastebin.com/lkajds;lkfjsdaf
    
Decrypting:

    $ gpgcrypt http://pastebin.com/lkajds;lkfjsdaf ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    


Later, you will be able to add other people's public keys to your ~/.gpgc folder.  Then you will be able to set their key as the default key.   

    $ gpgc --save-key pastebin.com/raw/;laksjdflkjdf joe
    $ gpgc --converse-with ~/.gpgc/joe
    $ gpgc "Hey, let me know when you've made the finishing touches."
